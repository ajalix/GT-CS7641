# GT-CS7641
Code used for Assignments for Georgia Institute of Technology, CS7641 - Machine Learning

This code is entirely derived from Chad Maron's code with minor tweaks for the datasets I used: https://github.com/cmaron/CS-7641-assignments

Primary datasets used are from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
Data sets used:
- Diabetes Retinopathy: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetic+Retinopathy+Debrecen+Data+Set
- QSAR Biodegradation: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/QSAR+biodegradation
